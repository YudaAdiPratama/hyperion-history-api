Scalable Full History API Solution for [Antelope](https://antelope.io/) (former EOSIO) based blockchains

Made with â™¥ by [EOS Rio](https://eosrio.io/)

### [Official documentation](https://hyperion.docs.eosrio.io)

### 1. Overview

Hyperion is a full history solution for indexing, storing and retrieving Antelope blockchain`s historical data.
Antelope protocol is highly scalable reaching up to tens of thousands of transactions per second demanding high performance indexing and optimized storage and querying solutions. Hyperion is developed to tackle those challenges providing open source software to be operated by block producers, infrastructure providers and dApp developers.

Focused on delivering faster search times, lower bandwidth overhead and easier usability for UI/UX developers, Hyperion implements an improved data structure
actions are stored in a flattened format
a parent field is added to the inline actions to point to the parent global sequence
if the inline action data is identical to the parent it is considered a notification and thus removed from the database
no blocks or transaction data is stored, all information can be reconstructed from actions

### 2. Architecture
The following components are required in order to have a fully functional Hyperion API deployment, 
for small use cases its absolutely fine to run all components on a single machine. For larger chains and 
production environments we recommend setting them up into different servers under a high-speed local network.

#### 2.1 Elasticsearch Cluster
The ES cluster is responsible for storing all indexed data.
Direct access to the Hyperion API and Indexer must be provided. We recommend nodes in the 
cluster to have at least 32 GB of RAM and 8 cpu cores. SSD/NVME drives are recommended for 
maximum indexing throughput, although HDDs can be used for cold storage nodes.
For production environments a multi-node cluster is highly recommended.

#### 2.2 Hyperion Indexer
The Indexer is a Node.js based app that process data from the state history plugin and allows it to be indexed.
The [PM2 process manager](https://pm2.keymetrics.io) is used to launch and operate the indexer. The configuration flexibility is very extensive, 
so system recommendations will depend on the use case and data load. It will require access to at least one ES node, 
RabbitMQ and the state history node.

#### 2.3 Hyperion API
Parallelizable API server that provides the V2 and V1 (legacy history plugin) endpoints.
It is launched by PM2 and can also operate in cluster mode. It requires direct access to 
at least one ES node for the queries and all other services for full healthcheck

#### 2.4 RabbitMQ
Used as messaging queue and data transport between the indexer stages and for real-time data streaming

#### 2.5 Redis
Used for transient data storage across processes and for the preemptive transaction caching used on the `v2/history/get_transaction` and `v2/history/check_transaction` endpoints

#### 2.6 Leap State History
[Leap / Nodeos](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/tree/main/plugins/state_history_plugin) plugin used to collect action traces and state deltas. Provides data via websocket to the indexer

#### 2.7 Hyperion Stream Client (optional)
Web and Node.js client for real-time streaming on enabled hyperion providers. [Documentation](https://hyperion.docs.eosrio.io/stream_client/)

#### 2.8 Hyperion Plugins (optional)
 Hyperion includes a flexible plugin architecture to allow further customization. Plugins are managed by the `hpm` command line tool.

Official plugins:
- [Hyperion Lightweight Explorer](https://github.com/eosrio/hyperion-explorer-plugin)
